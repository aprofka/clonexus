# Botxus - Messaging forwarding bot

So, this should work with standard bots and self-bots, but keep in mind that self-bots are against Discord's terms of service and are not officially supported by the newest discord modules/plugins. Self-botting could result in your account being banned, so use it with caution. 



## Instructions

1. Open config.json and set your discord token. 

2. Open index.js and add your source - target channels as seen in the file to the variable named "channelConfig".

3. Run `npm install` , `npm install github:nikita/discord.js`

4. Run `npm start`

*You might need to install some additional libraries
*If you get any errors for missing modules run 'npm install ''the name of the module missing'' '
