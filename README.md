# Clonexus - Messaging forwarding bot

So, this should work with standard bots and self-bots, but keep in mind that self-bots are against Discord's terms of service and are not officially supported by the newest discord modules/plugins. Self-botting could result in your account being banned, so use it with caution. 

This is primary made for my needs, so some of the functionality might not work for you or even need it. I have commented our these lines of code, so you can delete/comment them out. I am aware they are better way of doing some stuff, but cant be asked to change them. If it works, it works. 

## Instructions

1. Open config.json and set your discord token. 

2. Open index.js and add your source - target channels as seen in the file to the variable named "channelConfig".

3. Run `npm install` , `npm install github:nikita/discord.js`

4. Run `npm start`

*You might need to install some additional libraries
*If you get any errors for missing modules run 'npm install ''the name of the module missing'' '
